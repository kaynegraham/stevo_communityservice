Production-ready Community Service system for FiveM

stevo_communityservice is a configurable, event-driven community service system built for live FiveM roleplay servers.  
It is designed to be simple to configure, framework-agnostic, and reliable in real multiplayer environments.

This repository is a fork of the original project but remains fully in sync and reflects 100% of my own implementation work, including system logic, configuration design, and framework integrations.
